# terminalresume

my portfolio website basically.

## Inspiration

For a long time there has been a debate about how command line is the superior interface and people have strived to create more and more complex and more intricate tools for the CLI. What's the one thing that you remember from all those sci-fi movies and TV shows or shows set in space? I remember them always using a command line. The graphical interfaces were just visualisations for data and not much. So it would make sense to have a command line portfolio for use in space, right?

## What it does

It's a portfolio so it showcases some of my skills and projects but since it's styled after the command line, the commands and the structure is a lot similar to that.

## How I built it

HTML, CSS and Javascript. Nothing too complicated.

## Challenges I ran into

Creating a terminal-style interface that is both visually appealing and easy to use was challenging, but fun nevertheless.

Designing an intuitive navigation system so that the users can easily find what they are looking for and quickly navigate through the website was challenging but with proper planning and execution, it resulted in a unique and engaging website that showcases my resume.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

A command line simulation.
