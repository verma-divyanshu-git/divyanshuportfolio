this is my terminal themed portfolio website.

## Inspiration

For a long time we've talked about how command line is the superior interface and have strived to create more and more complex and more intricate tools for the CLI. What's the one thing that you remember from all those sci-fi movies and TV shows or shows set in space? I remember them always using a command line. The graphical interfaces were just visualisations for data and not much. So it would make sense to have a command line portfolio for use in space, right?

## What it does

It's a portfolio so it showcases some of the skills and projects of the user but since it's styled after the linux command line the commands and the structure is a lot similar to that.

## How we built it

HTML, CSS and Javascript. Nothing too complicated ;)

## Challenges we ran into

The thing about command line interfaces is that everyone has a different colour preference, some people like plain white text on a black background whereas some people like a combination of various colours. But hey, that can be easily modified.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

A command line simulation.

## What we learned

## What's next for Portfolio-CLI

Maybe a more scalable cloud based version? One that pulls data from a web server? One in which colours can be modified from the cli? A lot can be done which hopefully we are looking forward to do in near future.
